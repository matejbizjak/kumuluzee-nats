> KumuluzEE NATS project for developing microservices using NATS connective technology.

KumuluzEE NATS project for the KumuluzEE microservice framework provides easy-to-use annotations and configuration for developing microservices using NATS connective technology.
Both NATS Core and NATS JetStream are supported.

The project is using a [NATS.java](https://github.com/nats-io/nats.java) Java client to communicate with NATS servers.

NATS documentation is available [here](https://docs.nats.io/nats-concepts/overview). It's highly recommended to get familiar with NATS before using this project, especially if you are going to use JetStream module.
